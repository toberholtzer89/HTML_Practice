            Coffee is something of a phenomenon. Have you ever wondered 
            who was the brains behind the random notion that led to such a 
            staple across so many cultures? Think about it.

            1) Take a seed out of a rather "meh" cherry <br>
            2) Dry it out <br>
            3) Roast it <br> 
            4) Grind it <br>
            5) Steep it in hot water and then... <br>
            6) Dump the grounds and drink the leftovers?

            And yet, it's so...normal.
